[RootDirectory]
Specify the root directory under which Firebird is installed.
Can be used to override the OS-specifically determined one.

[DatabaseAccess]
Database Paths/Directories

DatabaseAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose Restrict,
provide ';'-separated trees list, where database files are stored.
Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry (see above).
Default value 'Full' gives full access to all files on your site.
To specify access to specific trees, enum all required paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\DataBase;D:\Mirror', for unix - '/db;/mnt/mirrordb'). If you choose 'None', then only databases listed in aliases.conf can be attached.

UNCONTROLLED DATABASE ACCESS MAY COMPROMISE YOUR SYSTEM!
IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT DATABASE LOCATIONS!

[ExternalFileAccess]
External File Paths/Directories

ExternalFileAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where external files are stored. Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry (see above).
Default value 'None' disables any use of external files on your site.
To specify access to specific trees, enum all required paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\ExternalTables', for unix - '/db/extern;/mnt/extern').

NOTE: THE EXTERNAL TABLE ENGINE FEATURE COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE THE SERVER/HOST AS WELL AS DATABASE SECURITY!!

IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT EXTERNAL TABLE LOCATIONS!

[UdfAccess]
External Function (UDF) Paths/Directories

UdfAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where UDF libraries are stored.
Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry (see above).
Default value 'Restrict UDF' provides the same restrictions as in FB 1.0.
To specify access to specific trees, enum all required paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\ExternalFunctions', for unix - '/db/extern;/mnt/extern').

NOTE: THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION ENGINE FEATURE COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE THE SERVER/HOST AS WELL AS DATABASE SECURITY!!

IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT EXTERNAL FUNCTION LOCATIONS!

[TempDirectories]
Temporary directories

Provide ';'-separated trees list, where temporary files are stored.
Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry (see above).
Default value is determined using FIREBIRD_TMP, TEMP or TMP environment options.
Every directory item may have optional size argument to limit its storage, this argument follows the directory name and must be separated by at least one space character.
If the size argument is omitted or invalid, then all available space in this directory will be used.

E.g.:
TempDirectories = c:\temp
or
TempDirectories = c:\temp;d:\temp
or
TempDirectories = c:\temp 100000000;d:\temp 500000000;e:\temp

[LegacyHash]
Legacy hash makes possible use of old security.fdb after running misc/upgrade/security_database.sql.
If you want to disable logons with old passwords after users' migration, set it to 0 (false).
Makes no difference when used with original security2.fdb - it can't contain DES hash.

[DefaultDbCachePages]
Number of cached database pages

This sets the number of pages from any one database that can be held in cache at once.
If you increase this value, the engine will allocate more pages to the cache for every database.
By default, the SuperServer allocates 2048 pages for each database and the classic allocates 75 pages per client connection per database.

[SortMemBlockSize]
In-memory sorting module

The amount of memory allocated for each sort block.

[SortMemUpperLimit]
The maximum amount of memory to be allocated by the in-memory sorting module.

For Classic servers, this setting is defaulted to 8 MB.
Although it can be increased, the value applies to each client connection/server instance and thus consumes a lot of memory.

[OldParameterOrdering]
Backward-compatible parameter ordering as it was in FB v1/IB

[CompleteBooleanEvaluation]
Boolean evaluation method (complete or shortcut)

If your SQL code depends on side-effects of full evaluation of OR and AND statements (right-hand-side terms), even if the expressions final result could be determined by just examining the value of the first term, you might need to turn this on.

[DeadlockTimeout]
Determines the number of seconds that the lock manager will wait after a conflict has been encountered before purging locks from dead processes and doing extra deadlock scan cycle.
Engine detects deadlocks instantly in all normal cases, so this value affects things only if something goes wrong.
Setting it too low may degrade system performance.

[MaxUnflushedWrites]
How often the pages are flushed on disk (for databases with ForcedWrites=Off only)

Number of unflushed writes which will accumulate before they are flushed, at the next transaction commit.
For non-Win32 ports, the default value is -1 (Disabled)

[MaxUnflushedWriteTime]
Number of seconds during which unflushed writes will accumulate before they are flushed, at the next transaction commit.
For non-Win32 ports, the default value is -1 (Disabled)

[BugcheckAbort]
This option controls whether to call abort() when internal error or BUGCHECK is encountered thus invoke post-mortem debugger which can dump core suitable for off-line analysis. When disabled engine tries to minimize damage and continue execution.

Note that setting this option to 1 makes engine produce traceable coredumps when something nasty like SIGSEGV happens inside UDF. On Windows enabling this option makes engine invoke JIT debugger facilities when errors happen.

For debugging builds (DEV_BUILD), default value is 1 (Enabled)

[OldColumnNaming]
Prior to Firebird 1.5 various SELECT expressions generated unnamed columns. This did not conform to the SQL standard. Fb 1.5 saw the introduction of default aliases for these unnamed columns.
In some cases, particularly if string concatenation is used (via the || operator) this breaks existing scripts.

This setting will affect aliases generated via CONCATENATION, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and EXTRACT.
Setting the value to true will disable the alias generation. It is only recommended to be used where legacy scripts need to be supported.
It will be marked deprecated in Firebird 2.0 and removed in Firebird 3.0.

[ConnectionTimeout]
Client Connection Settings (Basic)

Seconds to wait before concluding an attempt to connect has failed.

[DummyPacketInterval]
Seconds to wait on a silent client connection before the server sends dummy packets to request acknowledgment.

DO NOT USE THIS OPTION. It may hang or crash Windows on the client side as explained here: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=296265
or may not prevent eventual inactive client disconnection for other OS.

Normally, Firebird uses SO_KEEPALIVE socket option to keep track of active connections.
If you do not like default 2-hour keepalive timeout then adjust your server OS settings appropriately.
On UNIX-like OS's, modify contents of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_*.
On Windows, follow instrutions of this article: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=140325

[RemoteServiceName]
TCP Protocol Settings

The TCP Service name/Port number to be used for client database connections.

It is only necessary to change one of the entries, not both.
The order of precendence is the 'RemoteServiceName' (if an entry is found in the 'services.' file) then the 'RemoteServicePort'.

[RemoteServicePort]
TCP Protocol Settings

The TCP Service name/Port number to be used for client database connections.

It is only necessary to change one of the entries, not both.
The order of precendence is the 'RemoteServiceName' (if an entry is found in the 'services.' file) then the 'RemoteServicePort'.

[RemoteAuxPort]
The TCP Port Number to be used for server Event Notification messages.  The value of 0 (Zero) means that the server will choose a port number randomly.

[TcpRemoteBufferSize]
TCP/IP buffer size for send and receive buffers of both the client and server.
The engine reads ahead of the client and can send several rows of data in a single packet. The larger the packet size, the more data is sent per transfer. Range is 1448 to 32767 (MAX_SSHORT).

[TcpNoNagle]
Either enables or disables Nagle algorithm (TCP_NODELAY option of socket) of the socket connection.

Note: Currently is a default for classic and super servers.

[RemoteBindAddress]
Allows incoming connections to be bound to the IP address of a specific network card.
It enables rejection of incoming connections through any other network interface except this one.
By default, connections from any available network interface are allowed.

[LockMemSize]
Locking and shared memory parameters

Bytes of shared memory allocated for lock manager.
In Classic mode, the size given is used for the initial allocation.
The table expands dynamically up to the limit of memory.
In SuperServer, the initial size is also the final size.
Default is 96K on Linux and Solaris, 256K on Windows.

[LockSemCount]
Number of semaphores for interprocess communication.
In non-threading environments, this sets the number of semaphores available

[LockGrantOrder]
When a connection wants to lock an object, it gets a lock request block which specifies the object and the lock level requested.
Each locked object has a lock block.
Request blocks are connected to those lock blocks either as requests that have been granted, or as pending requests.

The settings:
	1 means locks are granted first come, first served.
	0 means emulate InterBase v3.3 behavior, where locks are granted
  as soon as they are available; can result in lock request starvation.

[LockAcquireSpins]
In Classic, only one client process may access the lock table at any time.
Access to the lock table is governed by a mutex.
The mutex can be requested conditionally - a wait is a failure and the request must be retried - or unconditionally - the request will wait until it is satisfied.
This parameter establishes the number of attempts that will be made conditionally. Zero value means unconditional mode.
Relevant only on SMP machines.

[LockHashSlots]
Tune lock hash list; more hash slots mean shorter hash chains.
Only necessary under very high load. Prime number values are recommended.

[EventMemSize]
Bytes of shared memory allocated for event manager.

[CpuAffinityMask]
Which CPUs should be used (Windows Only)

In an SMP system, sets which processors can be used by the server.
The value is taken from a bit map in which each bit represents a CPU.
Thus, to use only the first processor, the value is 1.
To use both CPU 1 and CPU 2, the value is 3. To use CPU 2 and CPU 3, the value is 6. The default value is 1.

[UsePriorityScheduler]
Settings for the thread scheduler	 (Windows Only)

If you have problems with computer response time, running firebird on workstation, turn off thread scheduler.

[PrioritySwitchDelay]
The wait time, in milli-seconds (ms), before the priority of:
 - an active thread is reduced to 'Low', or
 - an inactive thread is increased to 'High'

Note: The default value was chosen based on experiments on Intel PIII/P4 processors.
It should be increased for using in the computer with lower speed processors.

[PriorityBoost]
Number of additional 'intervals' given to a 'High' priority thread.

[GCPolicy]
Garbage collection policy

Defines how engine does garbage collection. Valid values are :
  cooperative
  background
  combined

Superserver has by default "combined" policy Classic has by default "cooperative" policy.
Other values are ignored by classic server build

[GuardianOption]
Does the guardian restart the server every time it crashes?
  0 - only start the engine/service once
  1 - always restart the engine/service if it terminates

[ProcessPriorityLevel]
Priority level/class for the server process.

The values are:
     0 (Zero) - normal priority,
     positive value - high priority (same as -B command line option)
     negative value - low priority.

Note: All changes to this value should be carefully tested to ensure that engine is more responsive to requests.

[IpcName]
Local Connection Settings

The name of the shared memory area used as a transport channel in local protocol.
Note that the local protocol in v2.0 is not compatible with any previous version if Firebird or InterBase.

IMPORTANT! If your host OS is Windows 2003 or Windows XP with the terminal services enabled and you need the local connection to work, you should prefix
the below value with "Global\", i.e. it should be "Global\FIREBIRD".
Please note that the prefix is case-sensitive.

[RemotePipeName]
The name of the pipe used as a transport channel in NetBEUI protocol.
Has the same meaning as a port number for TCP/IP. The default value is compatible with IB/FB1.

[LockSignal]
UNIX signal to use for interprocess communication

[RemoteFileOpenAbility]
Remove protection against opening databases on NFS mounted volumes

    ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING***

This option removes an important safety feature of Firebird and can cause irrecoverable database corruption.
Do not use this option unless you understand the risks and are prepared to accept the loss of the contents of your database.
Unless this configuration option is changed from 0 to 1, Firebird can open a database only if the database is stored on a drive physically attached to the local computer - the computer running that copy of Firebird.
Requests for connections to databases stored on NFS mounted drives are redirected to a Firebird server running on the computer that "owns" the disk.
This restriction prevents two different copies of Firebird from opening the same database without coordinating their activities.
Uncoordinated access by multiple copies of Firebird will corrupt a database.
On a localsystem, the system-level file locking prevents uncoordinated access to the database file.
NFS does not provide a reliable way to detect multiple users of a file on an NFS mounted disk.
If a second copy of Firebird connects to a database on an NFS mounted disk, it will corrupt the database.
Under some circumstances, running a Firebird server on the computer that owns NFS mounted volumes is inconvenient or impossible.
Applications that use the "embedded" variant of Firebird and never share access to a database can use this option to permit direct access to databases on NFS mounted volumes.

DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

[Redirection]
Remove protection against redirecting requests to other servers

    ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING***

Ability to redirect requests to other servers was initially present in Interbase, but was broken by Borland in Interbase 6.0, when they added SQL dialects.
Request redirection was fixed in firebird 2.0, but today such behaviour (proxy) seems to be dangerous from security point of view.
Imagine, you have one carefully protected firebird server, access to which is possible from global net.
But in case when this server has access to your internal LAN (may and should be restricted, but often possible), it will work as a gateway for incoming requests like: firebird.your.domain.com:internal_server:/private/database.fdb It's enough to know name/IP of some internal server on your LAN, and for this connection one even need not know login/password on external server.
Such gateway easily overrides firewall, installed to protect your LAN from outside attack.

DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

[DeadThreadsCollection]

[IpcMapSize]

[Authentication]
Which authentication method(s) should be used.
"native" means use of only traditional interbase/firebird authentication with security database.
"trusted" (Windows Only) makes use of window trusted authentication, and in some aspects this is the most secure way to authenticate.
"mixed" means both methods may be used.
